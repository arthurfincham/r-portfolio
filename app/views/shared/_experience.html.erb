    For my last few years at university I worked at Roger Gracie Academy, a world famous Brazilian Jiu Jitsu academy in London. My
    responsibilities include carrying out duties at the front desk and building and maintaining the academy's website. As well as working
    there, I have been training for around 3 years.

    When I was 17 I set up a food stall for Notting Hill Carnival. Over the years my love for cooking turned into a small catering company
    that I ran, doing dinner parties and small events for people around London. I set up the business myself and have learnt the ropes of
    hospitality and management on the job. We catered for anything from 4 to 30 people.

  <h4>Floor Runner</h4>

  <p class="fs-5 col-md-8">
    Over 6 weeks I worked as a runner during the production of Episodes, Showtime & BBC. Logistics and maintaining the smooth flow of the
    shoot were my main responsibilities. Being a team player amongst a crew of around 40 was essential, whilst strong motivation and diplomacy
    were needed for the early starts and long hours each day.
