<h3>Roger Gracie Academy</h3>
<h4>Front Desk</h4>
<h5 class="text-muted">Nov 2019 - Aug 2021</h5>
<p class="fs-6 col-md-8">
  For my last few years at university I worked at Roger Gracie Academy, a world famous Brazilian Jiu Jitsu academy in London. My
  responsibilities include carrying out duties at the front desk and building and maintaining the academy's website. As well as working
  there, I have been training for around 3 years.

<h3>Torni's Kitchen</h3>
<h4>Chef/Owner</h4>
<h5 class="text-muted">Jul 2016 - April 2019</h5>
<p class="fs-6 col-md-8">
  When I was 17 I set up a food stall for Notting Hill Carnival. Over the years my love for cooking turned into a small catering company
  that I ran, doing dinner parties and small events for people around London. I set up the business myself and have learnt the ropes of
  hospitality and management on the job. We catered for anything from 4 to 30 people.

<h3>Hat Trick Productions</h3>
<h4>Floor Runner</h4>
<h5 class="text-muted">May 2016 - June 2016</h5>
<p class="fs-6 col-md-8">
  Over 6 weeks I worked as a runner during the production of Episodes, Showtime & BBC. Logistics and maintaining the smooth flow of the
  shoot were my main responsibilities. Being a team player amongst a crew of around 40 was essential, whilst strong motivation and diplomacy
  were needed for the early starts and long hours each day.
